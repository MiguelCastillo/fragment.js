fragment.js
========

Asynchronous loading of html fragments.  This small loader will also process nested fragments via annotated html with mjs-fragment.<br><br>
Fragment.js depends on <a href="https://github.com/MiguelCastillo/resource.js">resource.js</a> for loading and chaching the html fragments.<br>
